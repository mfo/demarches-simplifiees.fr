# fog-openstack 1.1.x builds the bulk-delete request body with `URI.encode`, which
# Ruby removed in 3.0, so `delete_multiple_objects` raises NoMethodError on any
# non-empty object list. `URI::DEFAULT_PARSER.escape` is the drop-in replacement:
# same escaping rules, and it keeps the `container/object` slash literal (unlike
# `ERB::Util.url_encode`, which would encode it and break the path).
#
# We PREPEND a module rather than reopen the class: fog requires the original request
# file lazily, on the first `Fog::OpenStack::Storage.new` (setup_requirements ->
# require_requests_and_mock), which happens AFTER this initializer. A class reopen
# would then be redefined (clobbered) by that require; a prepended module stays ahead
# of Real in the ancestor chain and wins whatever the load order.
