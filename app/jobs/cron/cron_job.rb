class Cron::CronJob < ApplicationJob
  # A cron job is scheduled again anyway: the next run is the retry. With the
  # default budget of 25 retries, a nightly job that fails on a statement
  # timeout is retried for about three weeks, so a dozen instances of the same
  # job overlap and every failure yields a dozen Sentry events.
  #
  # A job whose run cannot be caught up by the next one raises its own budget with
  # `use_sidekiq_retry(max_retry:)` -- sized to its window, not to MAX_ATTEMPTS_JOBS.
  # `perform` recomputes the current date at every attempt, so once the retries reach
  # the next run (retry 14 lands a day later) they no longer redo the lost work: they
  # run the next run's scope, in addition to the next run. Past its own window, a
  # retry stops being a catch-up and becomes a duplicate.
