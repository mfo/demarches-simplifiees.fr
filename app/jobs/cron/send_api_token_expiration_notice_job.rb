  # drops out of the scope for good, and one expiring the next day gets its 1-day
  # notice after it has expired. Its sibling SendAPIEntrepriseTokenExpirationNoticeJob
  # has no such lower bound (`expired_or_expires_soon?`) and does catch up, hence no
  # budget there. 5 retries span 7 minutes: a retry past midnight already runs the
  # next day's scope, and `expiration_notices_sent_at` keeps duplicates out.
