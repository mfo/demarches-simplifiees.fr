    # `path_in_download_dir` comes from a user-controlled export template
    # (`ExportTemplate#attachment_path`), whose tags are substituted without
    # escaping: both the directory part and the basename can carry hostile input.
    # So we rebuild the path from explicitly filtered components — sanitizing every
    # one of them, not just the basename — rather than let `Pathname#join`/
    # `expand_path` resolve it for us:
    #   - an absolute path would replace the `destination` prefix entirely
    #   - a `..` that would climb out of the export dir is refused loudly, so a real
    #     escape attempt stays visible (logged, reported, listed in the error report)
    #     instead of being silently relocated somewhere inside the export
    #   - a `..` absorbed within the export dir is dropped rather than resolved:
    #     resolving it would collapse two paths that
    #     `DownloadableFileService.deduplicate_paths` believes to be distinct onto
    #     the same file. Dropping it keeps the attachment, under its own directory.
    #
    # The final check is an exact structural equality, not a prefix comparison: we
    # require the expanded path to be *literally* the export dir followed by the
    # components we chose. Comparing `..` against the literal string is not enough,
    # because `File.expand_path` honours spellings a string comparison misses, and
    # which ones it honours is platform dependent: on macOS it strips a leading
    # UTF-8 BOM, so a component of "﻿.." traverses like ".." (on Linux it stays a
    # plain directory name). Resolving it there would collapse two paths that
    # `DownloadableFileService.deduplicate_paths` believes to be distinct onto the
    # same file.
    #
    # The equality makes us safe on every platform without having to enumerate those
    # spellings: either `expand_path` normalises something and the two sides differ,
    # so we refuse, or it does not and the path is literally the export dir followed
    # by sanitized components (which can no longer contain a separator), hence
    # confined by construction. It also subsumes the sibling-directory case
    # (`/tmp/export-evil` vs `/tmp/export`), and a basename that is empty or is
    # itself `.`/`..` — none of those survive `expand_path` intact either.
